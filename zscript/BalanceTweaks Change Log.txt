Balance Changes V1 (Seperate Build)

BioRifle:
-Increased max size of blobs.
-Reduced minimum damage for 40~ (2 Hit kill an imp) but fully charged will
kill Hellknights and Mancubus.
-Reduced the amount of blobs created by scale.x to compensate bigger size.
-Made the altfire charge start with 1, reduced charge rate slightly
to compensate.

Flak Cannon:
-Increased primary damage by 10.
-Made damage fall off over time. (Pretty big falloff)
-Reduced smoke created by half.
-Increased secondary damage by 20.
-Increased fire arc.

Impact Hammer:
-Made both modes do increased knockback.

Minigun:
-Increased Primary fire rate.
-Increased Secondary Fire rate ALOT.
-Idea is to make the weapon an ammo guzzler, lots of death
for high DPS. And... to make it relevant against the utter
OPness of the double Enforcer.

PulseGun:
-Increased Primary Fire Damage.
-Doubled Primary fire ammo consumption (Based on 2004's link gun)
-Increased alt fire damage slightly.

Ripper:
-Small damage increase on both sides.
